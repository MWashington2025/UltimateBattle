  For this project I was assigned to create a sort of battle between two people. Within the code there is an end goal that the two players would reach and once reached the program will end and display the winner. Also within the code there is a section where throughout the battle a player would drink water and take a break while the other continues toward the end goal. For my code I used the characters Spongebob and Patrick as the players and the game they are playing is Jellyfishing, with an end goal of reaching 200 Jellyfish caught. They both would also be taking breaks and drinking water (yes, while underwater). 
  There are a few concepts used while writing this code one of them being threding (UltimateBattleApp.java), which allows for the code to run multiple parts of it at the same time. With threding within the main class, this allows for multiple actions within the different classes to combine and run simultaneously without conflict.
